# Image your SD Card

It is the most reliable method I have found.

Raspberry Pi OS (previously called Raspbian) is our official operating system for all models of the Raspberry Pi.

Use Raspberry Pi Imager for an easy way to install Raspberry Pi OS and other operating systems to an SD card ready to use with your Raspberry Pi:

* [Raspberry Pi Imager for Windows](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/)
* [Raspberry Pi Imager for macOS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/)
* [Raspberry Pi Imager for Ubuntu](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/)

I went with Ubuntu 20.04.1 (32 Bit)
